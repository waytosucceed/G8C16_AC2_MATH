      Alex is building a tall tower out of blocks. For each level of the tower, he places 3 blocks. On the first level, he uses 3<sup>1</sup> blocks, on the second level he uses 3<sup>2</sup> blocks, and on the third level, he uses 3<sup>3</sup> blocks, and so on. But then Alex realizes that if he uses negative or zero powers, the number of blocks changes! He starts wondering about the rules of exponents to make his tower stronger.
